"""

In this tutorial, we focus on the minimal steps required to implement a new model from scratch using Jack.

We will implement a simple Bi-LSTM baseline for extractive question answering.
The architecture is as follows:
- Words of question and support are embedded using random embeddings (not trained)
- Both word and question are encoded using a bi-directional LSTM
- The question is summarized by averaging its token representations
- A feedforward NN scores each of the support tokens to be the start of the answer
- A feedforward NN scores each of the support tokens to be the end of the answer

In order to implement a Jack reader, we define three modules:
- **Input Module**: Responsible for mapping `QASetting`s to numpy array assoicated with `TensorPort`s
- **Model Module**: Defines the TensorFlow graph
- **Output Module**: Converting the network output to the output of the system. In our case, this involves extracting the answer string from the context. We will use the existing `XQAOutputModule`.

## Ports

All communication between input, model and output modules happens via `TensorPort`s.
Normally, you should try to reuse ports wherever possible to be able to reuse modules as well.
If you need a new port, however, it is also straight-forward to define one.
For this tutorial, we will define most ports here.

## Input Module

The input module is responsible for converting `QASetting` instances to numpy
arrays, which are mapped to `TensorPort`s. Essentially, we are building a
feed dict used for training and inference.

You could implement the `InputModule` interface, but in many cases it'll be
easier to inherit from `OnlineInputModule`. Doing this, we need to:
- Define the output `TensorPort`s of our input module
- Implement the preprocessing (e.g. tokenization, mapping to embedding vectors, ...). The result of this step is one *annotation* per instance, e.g. a `dict`.
- Implement batching. Given a list of annotations, you need to define how to build the feed dict.
