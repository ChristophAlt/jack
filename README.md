**Jack the Reader** -- or **jack**, for short -- is a framework for building an testing models on a variety of tasks that require *reading comprehension*.

To get started, please see [How to Install and Run][install] and then you may
want to have a look at the [notebooks][notebooks].  Lastly, for a high-level explanation of the ideas and
vision, see [Understanding Jack the Reader][understanding].

# Quickstart Examples - Training and Usage of a Question Answering System

To illustrate how jack works, we will show how to train a question answering
model.

### Extractive Question Answering on SQuAD

First, download SQuAD and GloVe embeddings:

```shell
$ cd data/SQuAD/
$ ./download.sh
$ cd ../GloVe/
$ ./download.sh
$ cd ../..
```

Train a [FastQA][fastqa] model

```shell
$ python3 jack/train_reader.py with config='./conf/fastqa.yaml'
```

Note, you can add a flag `tensorboard_folder=.tb/fastqa` to write tensorboard
summaries to a provided path (here `.tb/fastqa`).

A copy of the model is written into the `model_dir` directory after each
training epoch.  These can be loaded using the commands below or see e.g.
[the showcase notebook][showcase].

```python
from jack import readers
from jack.core import QASetting

fastqa_reader = readers.fastqa_reader()
fastqa_reader.load_and_setup("./fastqa_reader")

support = """"It is a replica of the grotto at Lourdes, 
France where the Virgin Mary reputedly appeared to Saint Bernadette Soubirous in 1858. 
At the end of the main drive (and in a direct line that connects through 3 statues and the Gold Dome), 
is a simple, modern stone statue of Mary."""

answers = fastqa_reader([QASetting(
    question="To whom did the Virgin Mary allegedly appear in 1858 in Lourdes France?",
    support=[support]
)])
```

### Recognizing Textual Entailment on SNLI

First, download SNLI

```shell
$ ./data/SNLI/download.sh
```

Lastly, train a [Decomposable Attention Model][dam]

```bash
$ python3 jack/train_reader.py with config=tests/test_conf/dam_test.yaml
```

```python
from jack import readers
from jack.core import QASetting

dam_reader = readers.dam_snli_reader()
dam_reader.load_and_setup("tests/test_results/dam_reader_test")

answers = dam_reader([QASetting(
    question="The boy plays with the ball.",
    support=["The boy plays with the ball."]
)])
```

# Developer guidelines

- [Comply with the PEP 8 Style Guide][pep8]
- Make sure all your code runs from the top level directory, e.g.:

```shell
$ python3 ./jack/io/SNLI2jtr_v1.py
```
